UPDATE: This is my first project since finishing my college C++ class 2 weeks ago. Its more
of an effort to stay current in what I know so I dont forget it than anything else. Started
the barebones of the main and characters resource files.

UPDATE: Finished intro function, character class; started on story segment 01 where it gives 
a little introduction to the player arriving on the beach.

UPDATE: Cleaned up and condensed the continue functions yesterday while building the first
story segment function. The SSF is more of a continuation of the intro to set the tone of 
the player entering the game and I only ask that you judge me on my code, not my terrible
story telling because I know how bad that is already lol. The main thing about tonights
coding isnt actually coding, but planning. Up until this point everything has just been 
a general outline in my mind but tonight I took some time to plan things out and write 
them down as a progressive graph containing what I want to happen and how.

UPDATE: Attempted to do the weapons creation differently from the characters by making
a pointer to an array of of class objects but it just wasnt working out and I got
tired of the kernal dumps. Obviously need to look into the specifics of pointers more.
